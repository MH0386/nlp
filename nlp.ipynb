For the natural language processing done by the human brain, see Language processing in the brain.\\nNatural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language. It involves processing natural language datasets, such as text corpora or speech corpora, using either rule-based or probabilistic (i.e. statistical and, most recently, neural network-based) machine learning approaches. The goal is a computer capable of \"understanding\" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.\\nChallenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nFurther information: History of natural language processing\\nNatural language processing has its roots in the 1940s.[1] Already in 1940, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.\\n\\nSymbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s)[edit]\\nThe premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle\\'s Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.\\n\\n1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.[2]  However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe[3]) until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.\\n1960s: Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\". Ross Quillian\\'s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in a computer  memory at the time.[4]\\n1970s: During the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual ontologies\", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, the first chatterbots were written (e.g., PARRY).\\n1980s: The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP. Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology[5]), semantics (e.g., Lesk algorithm), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory[6]) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the Rhetorical Structure Theory). Other lines of research were continued, e.g., the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky. An important development (that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s) was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period.[7]\\nStatistical NLP (1990s–2010s)[edit]\\nUp until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore\\'s law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[8]\\n\\n1990s: Many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, such as IBM alignment models.  These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.  However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.\\n2000s: With the growth of the web, increasing amounts of raw (unannotated) language data has become available since the mid-1990s. Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms.  Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.  Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.  However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical.\\nNeural NLP (present)[edit]\\nIn 2003, word n-gram model, at the time the best statistical algorithm, was overperformed by a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling) by Yoshua Bengio with co-authors.[9]\\nIn 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling,[10] and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec. In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style (featuring many hidden layers) machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[11][12] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling[13] and parsing.[14][15] This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care[16] or protect patient privacy.[17]\\n\\nApproaches: Symbolic, statistical, neural networks[edit]\\nSymbolic approach, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols, coupled with a dictionary lookup, was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular:[18][19] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.\\nMachine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: \\n\\nboth statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts, whereas the rule-based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally.\\nlanguage models, produced by either statistical or neural networks methods, are more robust to both unfamiliar (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted) in comparison to the rule-based systems, which are also more costly to produce.\\nthe larger such a (probabilistic) language model is, the more accurate it becomes, in contrast to rule-based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems.\\nAlthough rule-based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020, they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023. \\nBefore that they were commonly used:\\n\\nwhen the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods, e.g., for the machine translation of low-resource languages such as provided by the Apertium system,\\nfor preprocessing in NLP pipelines, e.g., tokenization, or\\nfor postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines, e.g., for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses.\\nStatistical approach[edit]\\nIn the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter, which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches.[20][21]\\nThe earliest decision trees, producing systems of hard if–then rules, were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches.\\nOnly the introduction of hidden Markov models, applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach.\\n\\nNeural networks[edit]\\nFurther information: Artificial neural network\\nA major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since 2015,[22] the statistical approach was replaced by the neural networks approach, using word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words. \\nIntermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) have not been needed anymore. \\nNeural machine translation, based on then-newly-invented sequence-to-sequence transformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary for statistical machine translation.\\n\\nCommon NLP tasks[edit]\\nThe following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.\\nThough natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.\\n\\nText and speech processing[edit]\\nOptical character recognition (OCR)\\nGiven an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.\\nSpeech recognition\\nGiven a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  This is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed \"AI-complete\" (see above).  In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below). In most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation, so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process. Also, given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents, the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent.\\nSpeech segmentation\\nGiven a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separate it into words.  A subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it.\\nText-to-speech\\nGiven a text, transform those units and produce a spoken representation. Text-to-speech can be used to aid the visually impaired.[23]\\nWord segmentation (Tokenization)\\nSeparate a chunk of continuous text into separate words. For a language like English, this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces. However, some written languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language. Sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words (BOW) creation in data mining.\\nMorphological analysis[edit]\\nLemmatization\\nThe task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma. Lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form. But in this case, the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form.[24]\\nMorphological segmentation\\nSeparate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes. The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology (i.e., the structure of words) of the language being considered. English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g., \"open, opens, opened, opening\") as separate words. In languages such as Turkish or Meitei, a highly agglutinated Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.[25]\\nPart-of-speech tagging\\nGiven a sentence, determine the part of speech (POS) for each word. Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple parts of speech. For example, \"book\" can be a noun (\"the book on the table\") or verb (\"to book a flight\"); \"set\" can be a noun, verb or adjective; and \"out\" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.\\nStemming\\nThe process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to a base form (e.g., \"close\" will be the root for \"closed\", \"closing\", \"close\", \"closer\" etc.). Stemming yields similar results as lemmatization, but does so on grounds of rules, not a dictionary.\\nSyntactic analysis[edit]\\nPart of a series onFormal languages\\nKey concepts\\nFormal system\\nAlphabet\\nSyntax\\nSemantics (computer science)\\nSemantics (logic)\\nFormal grammar\\nAutomata theory\\nGround expression\\nRegular expression\\nWell-formed formula\\n\\nApplications\\nFormal methods\\nPropositional calculus\\nPredicate logic\\nMathematical notation\\nNatural language processing\\nProgramming language theory\\nComputational linguistics\\nSyntax analysis\\nFormal verification\\nvte\\nGrammar induction[26]\\nGenerate a formal grammar that describes a language\\'s syntax.\\nSentence breaking (also known as \"sentence boundary disambiguation\")\\nGiven a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries. Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g., marking abbreviations).\\nParsing\\nDetermine the parse tree (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence. The grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses: perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human). There are two primary types of parsing: dependency parsing and constituency parsing. Dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like primary objects and predicates), whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) (see also stochastic grammar).\\nLexical semantics (of individual words in context)[edit]\\nLexical semantics\\nWhat is the computational meaning of individual words in context?\\nDistributional semantics\\nHow can we learn semantic representations from data?\\nNamed entity recognition (NER)\\nGiven a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization). Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case, is often inaccurate or insufficient.  For example, the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. Chinese or Arabic) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names. For example, German capitalizes all nouns, regardless of whether they are names, and French and Spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives. Another name for this task is token classification.[27]\\nSentiment analysis (see also Multimodal sentiment analysis)\\nExtract subjective information usually from a set of documents, often using online reviews to determine \"polarity\" about specific objects. It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in social media, for marketing.\\nTerminology extraction\\nThe goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.\\nWord-sense disambiguation (WSD)\\nMany words have more than one meaning; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context.  For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g. from a dictionary or an online resource such as WordNet.\\nEntity linking\\nMany words—typically proper names—refer to named entities; here we have to select the entity (a famous individual, a location, a company, etc.) which is referred to in context.\\nRelational semantics (semantics of individual sentences)[edit]\\nRelationship extraction\\nGiven a chunk of text, identify the relationships among named entities (e.g. who is married to whom).\\nSemantic parsing\\nGiven a piece of text (typically a sentence), produce a formal representation of its semantics, either as a graph (e.g., in AMR parsing) or in accordance with a logical formalism (e.g., in DRT parsing). This challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary NLP tasks from semantics (e.g., semantic role labelling, word-sense disambiguation) and can be extended to include full-fledged discourse analysis (e.g., discourse analysis, coreference; see Natural language understanding below).\\nSemantic role labelling (see also implicit semantic role labelling below)\\nGiven a single sentence, identify and disambiguate semantic predicates (e.g., verbal frames), then identify and classify the frame elements (semantic roles).\\nDiscourse (semantics beyond individual sentences)[edit]\\nCoreference resolution\\nGiven a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words (\"mentions\") refer to the same objects (\"entities\"). Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer. The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called \"bridging relationships\" involving referring expressions. For example, in a sentence such as \"He entered John\\'s house through the front door\", \"the front door\" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John\\'s house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).\\nDiscourse analysis\\nThis rubric includes several related tasks.  One task is discourse parsing, i.e., identifying the discourse structure of a connected text, i.e. the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences (e.g. elaboration, explanation, contrast).  Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text (e.g. yes–no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.).\\nImplicit semantic role labelling\\nGiven a single sentence, identify and disambiguate semantic predicates (e.g., verbal frames) and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence (see Semantic role labelling above). Then, identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence, classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified, and resolve the former against the local text. A closely related task is zero anaphora resolution, i.e., the extension of coreference resolution to pro-drop languages.\\nRecognizing textual entailment\\nGiven two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other\\'s negation, or allows the other to be either true or false.[28]\\nTopic segmentation and recognition\\nGiven a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.\\nArgument mining\\nThe goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs.[29] Such argumentative structures include the premise, conclusions, the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument, or the main and counter-argument within discourse.[30][31]\\nHigher-level NLP applications[edit]\\nAutomatic summarization (text summarization)\\nProduce a readable summary of a chunk of text.  Often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type, such as research papers, articles in the financial section of a newspaper.\\nGrammatical error correction\\nGrammatical error detection and correction involves a great band-width of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis (phonology/orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics). Grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire English as a second language. It has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since 2011.[32][33][34] As far as orthography, morphology, syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned, and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as GPT-2, this can now (2019) be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications.\\nLogic translation\\nTranslate a text from a natural language into formal logic.\\nMachine translation (MT)\\nAutomatically translate text from one human language to another.  This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed \"AI-complete\", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) to solve properly.\\nNatural-language understanding (NLU)\\nConvert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first-order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate. Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts. Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions. An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closed-world assumption (CWA) vs. open-world assumption, or subjective Yes/No vs. objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.[35]\\nNatural-language generation (NLG):\\nConvert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language.\\nBook generation\\nNot an NLP task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other NLP tasks is the creation of full-fledged books. The first machine-generated book was created by a rule-based system in 1984 (Racter, The policeman\\'s beard is half-constructed).[36] The first published work by a neural network was published in 2018, 1 the Road, marketed as a novel, contains sixty million words. Both these systems are basically elaborate but non-sensical (semantics-free) language models. The first machine-generated science book was published in 2019 (Beta Writer, Lithium-Ion Batteries, Springer, Cham).[37] Unlike Racter and 1 the Road, this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization.\\nDocument AI\\nA Document AI platform sits on top of the NLP technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence, machine learning or NLP to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types. NLP-powered Document AI enables non-technical teams to quickly access information hidden in documents, for example, lawyers, business analysts and accountants.[38]\\nDialogue management\\nComputer systems intended to converse with a human.\\nQuestion answering\\nGiven a human-language question, determine its answer. Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as \"What is the capital of Canada?\"), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as \"What is the meaning of life?\").\\nText-to-image generation\\nGiven a description of an image, generate an image that matches the description.[39]\\nText-to-scene generation\\nGiven a description of a scene, generate a 3D model of the scene.[40][41]\\nText-to-video\\nGiven a description of a video, generate a video that matches the description.[42][43]\\nGeneral tendencies and (possible) future directions[edit]\\nBased on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:[44]\\n\\nInterest on increasingly abstract, \"cognitive\" aspects of natural language (1999–2001: shallow parsing, 2002–03: named entity recognition, 2006–09/2017–18: dependency syntax, 2004–05/2008–09 semantic role labelling, 2011–12 coreference, 2015–16: discourse parsing, 2019: semantic parsing).\\nIncreasing interest in multilinguality, and, potentially, multimodality (English since 1999; Spanish, Dutch since 2002; German since 2003; Bulgarian, Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish since 2006; Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish since 2007; Czech since 2009; Arabic since 2012; 2017: 40+ languages; 2018: 60+/100+ languages)\\nElimination of symbolic representations (rule-based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods, representation learning and end-to-end systems)\\nCognition[edit]\\nMost higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above).\\nCognition refers to \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\"[45] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.[46] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[47] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies.\\nAs an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[48] with two defining aspects:\\n\\nApply the theory of conceptual metaphor, explained by Lakoff as \"the understanding of one idea, in terms of another\" which provides an idea of the intent of the author.[49] For example, consider the English word big. When used in a comparison (\"That is a big tree\"), the author\\'s intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience.  When used metaphorically (\"Tomorrow is a big day\"), the author\\'s intent to imply importance.  The intent behind other usages, like in \"She is a big person\", will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information.\\nAssign relative measures of meaning to a word, phrase, sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed, e.g., by means of a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in  US Patent 9269353:[50]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nR\\nM\\nM\\n(\\nt\\no\\nk\\ne\\n\\nn\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n=\\n\\nP\\nM\\nM\\n(\\nt\\no\\nk\\ne\\n\\nn\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n×\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\n∑\\n\\ni\\n=\\n−\\nd\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\n(\\n(\\nP\\nM\\nM\\n(\\nt\\no\\nk\\ne\\n\\nn\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n×\\n\\nP\\nF\\n(\\nt\\no\\nk\\ne\\n\\nn\\n\\nN\\n−\\ni\\n\\n\\n,\\nt\\no\\nk\\ne\\n\\nn\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\n,\\nt\\no\\nk\\ne\\n\\nn\\n\\nN\\n+\\ni\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {RMM(token_{N})}={PMM(token_{N})}\\\\times {\\\\frac {1}{2d}}\\\\left(\\\\sum _{i=-d}^{d}{((PMM(token_{N})}\\\\times {PF(token_{N-i},token_{N},token_{N+i}))_{i}}\\\\right)}\\n\\n\\nWhere\\nRMM is the relative measure of meaning\\ntoken is any block of text, sentence, phrase or word\\nN is the number of tokens being analyzed\\nPMM is the probable measure of meaning based on a corpora\\nd is the non zero location of the token along the sequence of N tokens\\nPF is the probability function specific to a language\\nTies with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,[51] functional grammar,[52] construction grammar,[53] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences[54] of the ACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of \"cognitive AI\".[55] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit)[56] and developments in artificial intelligence, specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches[57] and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle[58] by British neuroscientist and theoretician at University College London Karl J. Friston.\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\n1 the Road\\nArtificial intelligence detection software\\nAutomated essay scoring\\nBiomedical text mining\\nCompound term processing\\nComputational linguistics\\nComputer-assisted reviewing\\nControlled natural language\\nDeep learning\\nDeep linguistic processing\\nDistributional semantics\\nForeign language reading aid\\nForeign language writing aid\\nInformation extraction\\nInformation retrieval\\nLanguage and Communication Technologies\\nLanguage model\\nLanguage technology\\nLatent semantic indexing\\nMulti-agent system\\nNative-language identification\\nNatural-language programming\\nNatural-language understanding\\nNatural-language search\\nOutline of natural language processing\\nQuery expansion\\nQuery understanding\\nReification (linguistics)\\nSpeech processing\\nSpoken dialogue systems\\nText-proofing\\nText simplification\\nTransformer (machine learning model)\\nTruecasing\\nQuestion answering\\nWord2vec\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"NLP\".\\n\\n^ Hutchins, J.

The creation and use of such corpora of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for natural language processing.  In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called \"poverty of the stimulus\" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing.  As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing.\\n\\n^ Bengio, Yoshua; Ducharme, Réjean; Vincent, Pascal; Janvin, Christian (March 1, 2003). \"A neural probabilistic language model\".

 see NLP This article is about natural language processing done by computers  For the natural language processing done by the human brain  see Language processing in the brain  Natural language processing  NLP  is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics  It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language  It involves processing natural language datasets  such as text corpora or speech corpora  using either rule based or probabilistic  i e  statistical and  most recently  neural network based  machine learning approaches  The goal is a computer capable of  understanding  the contents of documents  including the contextual nuances of the language within them  The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves  Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition  natural language understanding  and natural language generation    History edit  Further information  History of natural language processing Natural language processing has its roots in the 1940s  1  Already in 1940  Alan Turing published an article titled  Computing Machinery and Intelligence  which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence  though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence  The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language   Symbolic NLP  1950s   early 1990s  edit  The premise of symbolic NLP is well summarized by John Searle s Chinese room experiment  Given a collection of rules  e g   a Chinese phrasebook  with questions and matching answers   the computer emulates natural language understanding  or other NLP tasks  by applying those rules to the data it confronts   1950s  The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English  The authors claimed that within three or five years  machine translation would be a solved problem  2   However  real progress was much slower  and after the ALPAC report in 1966  which found that ten year long research had failed to fulfill the expectations  funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced  Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America  though some research continued elsewhere  such as Japan and Europe 3   until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed  1960s  Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU  a natural language system working in restricted  blocks worlds  with restricted vocabularies  and ELIZA  a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist  written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966  Using almost no information about human thought or emotion  ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human like interaction  When the  patient  exceeded the very small knowledge base  ELIZA might provide a generic response  for example  responding to  My head hurts  with  Why do you say your head hurts    Ross Quillian s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words  because that was all that would fit in a computer  memory at the time  4  1970s  During the 1970s  many programmers began to write  conceptual ontologies   which structured real world information into computer understandable data   Examples are MARGIE  Schank  1975   SAM  Cullingford  1978   PAM  Wilensky  1978   TaleSpin  Meehan  1976   QUALM  Lehnert  1977   Politics  Carbonell  1979   and Plot Units  Lehnert 1981    During this time  the first chatterbots were written  e g   PARRY   1980s  The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP  Focus areas of the time included research on rule based parsing  e g   the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar   morphology  e g   two level morphology 5    semantics  e g   Lesk algorithm   reference  e g   within Centering Theory 6   and other areas of natural language understanding  e g   in the Rhetorical Structure Theory   Other lines of research were continued  e g   the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky  An important development  that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s  was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period  7  Statistical NLP  1990s 2010s  edit  Up until the 1980s  most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand written rules   Starting in the late 1980s  however  there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing   This was due to both the steady increase in computational power  see Moore s law  and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics  e g  transformational grammar   whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine learning approach to language processing  8   1990s  Many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation  due especially to work at IBM Research  such as IBM alignment models   These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government   However  most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems  which was  and often continues to be  a major limitation in the success of these systems  As a result  a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data  2000s  With the growth of the web  increasing amounts of raw  unannotated  language data has become available since the mid 1990s  Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi supervised learning algorithms   Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non annotated data   Generally  this task is much more difficult than supervised learning  and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data   However  there is an enormous amount of non annotated data available  including  among other things  the entire content of the World Wide Web   which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical  Neural NLP  present  edit  In 2003  word n gram model  at the time the best statistical algorithm  was overperformed by a multi layer perceptron  with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling  by Yoshua Bengio with co authors  9  In 2010  Tom   Mikolov  then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology  with co authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling  10  and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec  In the 2010s  representation learning and deep neural network style  featuring many hidden layers  machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing  That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques 11  12  can achieve state of the art results in many natural language tasks  e g   in language modeling 13  and parsing  14  15  This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare  where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care 16  or protect patient privacy  17   Approaches  Symbolic  statistical  neural networks edit  Symbolic approach  i e   the hand coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols  coupled with a dictionary lookup  was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular  18  19  such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming  Machine learning approaches  which include both statistical and neural networks  on the other hand  have many advantages over the symbolic approach    both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts  whereas the rule based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally  language models  produced by either statistical or neural networks methods  are more robust to both unfamiliar  e g  containing words or structures that have not been seen before  and erroneous input  e g  with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted  in comparison to the rule based systems  which are also more costly to produce  the larger such a  probabilistic  language model is  the more accurate it becomes  in contrast to rule based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems  Although rule based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020  they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023   Before that they were commonly used   when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods  e g   for the machine translation of low resource languages such as provided by the Apertium system  for preprocessing in NLP pipelines  e g   tokenization  or for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines  e g   for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses  Statistical approach edit  In the late 1980s and mid 1990s  the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter  which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule based approaches  20  21  The earliest decision trees  producing systems of hard if then rules  were still very similar to the old rule based approaches  Only the introduction of hidden Markov models  applied to part of speech tagging  announced the end of the old rule based approach   Neural networks edit  Further information  Artificial neural network A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering  Since 2015  22  the statistical approach was replaced by the neural networks approach  using word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words   Intermediate tasks  e g   part of speech tagging and dependency parsing  have not been needed anymore   Neural machine translation  based on then newly invented sequence to sequence transformations  made obsolete the intermediate steps  such as word alignment  previously necessary for statistical machine translation   Common NLP tasks edit  The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing  Some of these tasks have direct real world applications  while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks  Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined  they can be subdivided into categories for convenience  A coarse division is given below   Text and speech processing edit  Optical character recognition  OCR  Given an image representing printed text  determine the corresponding text  Speech recognition Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking  determine the textual representation of the speech   This is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed  AI complete   see above    In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words  and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition  see below   In most spoken languages  the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation  so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process  Also  given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents  the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent  Speech segmentation Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking  separate it into words   A subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it  Text to speech Given a text  transform those units and produce a spoken representation  Text to speech can be used to aid the visually impaired  23  Word segmentation  Tokenization  Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words  For a language like English  this is fairly trivial  since words are usually separated by spaces  However  some written languages like Chinese  Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion  and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language  Sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words  BOW  creation in data mining  Morphological analysis edit  Lemmatization The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma  Lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form  But in this case  the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form  24  Morphological segmentation Separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes  The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology  i e   the structure of words  of the language being considered  English has fairly simple morphology  especially inflectional morphology  and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word  e g    open  opens  opened  opening   as separate words  In languages such as Turkish or Meitei  a highly agglutinated Indian language  however  such an approach is not possible  as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms  25  Part of speech tagging Given a sentence  determine the part of speech  POS  for each word  Many words  especially common ones  can serve as multiple parts of speech  For example   book  can be a noun   the book on the table   or verb   to book a flight     set  can be a noun  verb or adjective  and  out  can be any of at least five different parts of speech  Stemming The process of reducing inflected  or sometimes derived  words to a base form  e g    close  will be the root for  closed    closing    close    closer  etc    Stemming yields similar results as lemmatization  but does so on grounds of rules  not a dictionary  Syntactic analysis edit  Part of a series onFormal languages Key concepts Formal system Alphabet Syntax Semantics  computer science  Semantics  logic  Formal grammar Automata theory Ground expression Regular expression Well formed formula  Applications Formal methods Propositional calculus Predicate logic Mathematical notation Natural language processing Programming language theory Computational linguistics Syntax analysis Formal verification vte Grammar induction 26  Generate a formal grammar that describes a language s syntax  Sentence breaking  also known as  sentence boundary disambiguation   Given a chunk of text  find the sentence boundaries  Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks  but these same characters can serve other purposes  e g   marking abbreviations   Parsing Determine the parse tree  grammatical analysis  of a given sentence  The grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses  perhaps surprisingly  for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses  most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human   There are two primary types of parsing  dependency parsing and constituency parsing  Dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence  marking things like primary objects and predicates   whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic context free grammar  PCFG   see also stochastic grammar   Lexical semantics  of individual words in context  edit  Lexical semantics What is the computational meaning of individual words in context  Distributional semantics How can we learn semantic representations from data  Named entity recognition  NER  Given a stream of text  determine which items in the text map to proper names  such as people or places  and what the type of each such name is  e g  person  location  organization   Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English  this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity  and in any case  is often inaccurate or insufficient   For example  the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized  and named entities often span several words  only some of which are capitalized   Furthermore  many other languages in non Western scripts  e g  Chinese or Arabic  do not have any capitalization at all  and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names  For example  German capitalizes all nouns  regardless of whether they are names  and French and Spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives  Another name for this task is token classification  27  Sentiment analysis  see also Multimodal sentiment analysis  Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents  often using online reviews to determine  polarity  about specific objects  It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in social media  for marketing  Terminology extraction The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus  Word sense disambiguation  WSD  Many words have more than one meaning  we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context   For this problem  we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses  e g  from a dictionary or an online resource such as WordNet  Entity linking Many words typically proper names refer to named entities  here we have to select the entity  a famous individual  a location  a company  etc   which is referred to in context  Relational semantics  semantics of individual sentences  edit  Relationship extraction Given a chunk of text  identify the relationships among named entities  e g  who is married to whom   Semantic parsing Given a piece of text  typically a sentence   produce a formal representation of its semantics  either as a graph  e g   in AMR parsing  or in accordance with a logical formalism  e g   in DRT parsing   This challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary NLP tasks from semantics  e g   semantic role labelling  word sense disambiguation  and can be extended to include full fledged discourse analysis  e g   discourse analysis  coreference  see Natural language understanding below   Semantic role labelling  see also implicit semantic role labelling below  Given a single sentence  identify and disambiguate semantic predicates  e g   verbal frames   then identify and classify the frame elements  semantic roles   Discourse  semantics beyond individual sentences  edit  Coreference resolution Given a sentence or larger chunk of text  determine which words   mentions   refer to the same objects   entities    Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task  and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer  The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so called  bridging relationships  involving referring expressions  For example  in a sentence such as  He entered John s house through the front door    the front door  is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John s house  rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to   Discourse analysis This rubric includes several related tasks   One task is discourse parsing  i e   identifying the discourse structure of a connected text  i e  the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences  e g  elaboration  explanation  contrast    Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text  e g  yes no question  content question  statement  assertion  etc    Implicit semantic role labelling Given a single sentence  identify and disambiguate semantic predicates  e g   verbal frames  and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence  see Semantic role labelling above   Then  identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence  classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified  and resolve the former against the local text  A closely related task is zero anaphora resolution  i e   the extension of coreference resolution to pro drop languages  Recognizing textual entailment Given two text fragments  determine if one being true entails the other  entails the other s negation  or allows the other to be either true or false  28  Topic segmentation and recognition Given a chunk of text  separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic  and identify the topic of the segment  Argument mining The goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs  29  Such argumentative structures include the premise  conclusions  the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument  or the main and counter argument within discourse  30  31  Higher level NLP applications edit  Automatic summarization  text summarization  Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text   Often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type  such as research papers  articles in the financial section of a newspaper  Grammatical error correction Grammatical error detection and correction involves a great band width of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis  phonology orthography  morphology  syntax  semantics  pragmatics   Grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire English as a second language  It has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since 2011  32  33  34  As far as orthography  morphology  syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned  and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as GPT 2  this can now  2019  be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications  Logic translation Translate a text from a natural language into formal logic  Machine translation  MT  Automatically translate text from one human language to another   This is one of the most difficult problems  and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed  AI complete   i e  requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess  grammar  semantics  facts about the real world  etc   to solve properly  Natural language understanding  NLU  Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate  Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts  Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions  An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closed world assumption  CWA  vs  open world assumption  or subjective Yes No vs  objective True False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization  35  Natural language generation  NLG   Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language  Book generation Not an NLP task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other NLP tasks is the creation of full fledged books  The first machine generated book was created by a rule based system in 1984  Racter  The policeman s beard is half constructed   36  The first published work by a neural network was published in 2018  1 the Road  marketed as a novel  contains sixty million words  Both these systems are basically elaborate but non sensical  semantics free  language models  The first machine generated science book was published in 2019  Beta Writer  Lithium Ion Batteries  Springer  Cham   37  Unlike Racter and 1 the Road  this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization  Document AI A Document AI platform sits on top of the NLP technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence  machine learning or NLP to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types  NLP powered Document AI enables non technical teams to quickly access information hidden in documents  for example  lawyers  business analysts and accountants  38  Dialogue management Computer systems intended to converse with a human  Question answering Given a human language question  determine its answer  Typical questions have a specific right answer  such as  What is the capital of Canada     but sometimes open ended questions are also considered  such as  What is the meaning of life     Text to image generation Given a description of an image  generate an image that matches the description  39  Text to scene generation Given a description of a scene  generate a 3D model of the scene  40  41  Text to video Given a description of a video  generate a video that matches the description  42  43  General tendencies and  possible  future directions edit  Based on long standing trends in the field  it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP  As of 2020  three trends among the topics of the long standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed  44   Interest on increasingly abstract   cognitive  aspects of natural language  1999 2001  shallow parsing  2002 03  named entity recognition  2006 09 2017 18  dependency syntax  2004 05 2008 09 semantic role

Arabic since 2012  2017  40  languages  2018  60  100  languages  Elimination of symbolic representations  rule based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods  representation learning and end to end systems  Cognition edit  Most higher level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language  More broadly speaking  the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP  see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above   Cognition refers to  the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought  experience  and the senses   45  Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary  scientific study of the mind and its processes  46  Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics  combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics  47  Especially during the age of symbolic NLP  the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies  As an example  George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing  NLP  algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science  along with the findings of cognitive linguistics  48  with two defining aspects   Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor  explained by Lakoff as  the understanding of one idea  in terms of another  which provides an idea of the intent of the author  49  For example  consider the English word big  When used in a comparison   That is a big tree    the author s intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience   When used metaphorically   Tomorrow is a big day    the author s intent to imply importance   The intent behind other usages  like in  She is a big person   will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information  Assign relative measures of meaning to a word  phrase  sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed  e g   by means of a probabilistic context free grammar  PCFG   The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in  US Patent 9269353  50       R M M   t o k e  n  N         P M M   t o k e  n  N          1  2 d            i

is the number of tokens being analyzed PMM is the probable measure of meaning based on a corpora d is the non zero location of the token along the sequence of N tokens PF is the probability function specific to a language Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP  but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s  Nevertheless  approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks  e g   of cognitive grammar  51  functional grammar  52  construction grammar  53  computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience  e g   ACT R   however  with limited uptake in mainstream NLP  as measured by presence on major conferences 54  of the ACL   More recently  ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability  e g   under the notion of  cognitive AI   55  Likewise  ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP  although rarely made explicit  56  and developments in artificial intelligence  specifically tools and technologies using large language

investigation of  corner cases  that stress the limits of its theoretical models  comparable to pathological phenomena in mathematics   typically created using thought experiments  rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real world data  as is the case in corpus linguistics   The creation and use of such corpora of real world data is a fundamental part of machine learning algorithms for natural language processing   In addition  theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so called  poverty of the stimulus  argument entail that general learning algorithms  as are typically used in machine learning  cannot be successful in language processing   As a result  the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to

Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Field of linguistics and computer science For other uses see NLP This article is about natural language processing done by computers For the natural language processing done by the human brain see Language processing in the brain Natural language processing NLP is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language It involves processing natural language datasets such as text corpora or speech corpora using either rule based or probabilistic i e statistical and most recently neural network based machine learning approaches The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents including the contextual nuances of the language within them The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition natural language understanding and natural language generation History edit Further information History of natural language processing Natural language processing has its roots in the 1940s 1 Already in 1940 Alan Turing published an article titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language Symbolic NLP 1950s early 1990s edit The premise of symbolic NLP is well summarized by John Searle s Chinese room experiment Given a collection of rules e g a Chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other NLP tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English The authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem 2 However real progress was much slower and after the ALPAC report in 1966 which found that ten year long research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America though some research continued elsewhere such as Japan and Europe 3 until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and ELIZA a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 Using almost no information about human thought or emotion ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human like interaction When the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base ELIZA might provide a generic response for example responding to My head hurts with Why do you say your head hurts Ross Quillian s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time 4 1970s During the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured real world information into computer understandable data Examples are MARGIE Schank 1975 SAM Cullingford 1978 PAM Wilensky 1978 TaleSpin Meehan 1976 QUALM Lehnert 1977 Politics Carbonell 1979 and Plot Units Lehnert 1981 During this time the first chatterbots were written e g PARRY 1980s The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP Focus areas of the time included research on rule based parsing e g the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology e g two level morphology 5 semantics e g Lesk algorithm reference e g within Centering Theory 6 and other areas of natural language understanding e g in the Rhetorical Structure Theory Other lines of research were continued e g the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky An important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period 7 Statistical NLP 1990s 2010s edit Up until the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand written rules Starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing This was due to both the steady increase in computational power see Moore s law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics e g transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine learning approach to language processing 8 1990s Many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at IBM Research such as IBM alignment models These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government However most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems As a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s With the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data has become available since the mid 1990s Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi supervised learning algorithms Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non annotated data Generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data However there is an enormous amount of non annotated data available including among other things the entire content of the World Wide Web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical Neural NLP present edit In 2003 word n gram model at the time the best statistical algorithm was overperformed by a multi layer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling by Yoshua Bengio with co authors 9 In 2010 Tom Mikolov then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology with co authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling 10 and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec In the 2010s representation learning and deep neural network style featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques 11 12 can achieve state of the art results in many natural language tasks e g in language modeling 13 and parsing 14 15 This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care 16 or protect patient privacy 17 Approaches Symbolic statistical neural networks edit Symbolic approach i e the hand coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular 18 19 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming Machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the rule based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar e g containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input e g with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the rule based systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to rule based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems Although rule based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023 Before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods e g for the machine translation of low resource languages such as provided by the Apertium system for preprocessing in NLP pipelines e g tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines e g for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses Statistical approach edit In the late 1980s and mid 1990s the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule based approaches 20 21 The earliest decision trees producing systems of hard if then rules were still very similar to the old rule based approaches Only the introduction of hidden Markov models applied to part of speech tagging announced the end of the old rule based approach Neural networks edit Further information Artificial neural network A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering Since 2015 22 the statistical approach was replaced by the neural networks approach using word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words Intermediate tasks e g part of speech tagging and dependency parsing have not been needed anymore Neural machine translation based on then newly invented sequence to sequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation Common NLP tasks edit The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing Some of these tasks have direct real world applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience A coarse division is given below Text and speech processing edit Optical character recognition OCR Given an image representing printed text determine the corresponding text Speech recognition Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking determine the textual representation of the speech This is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed AI complete see above In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition see below In most spoken languages the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process Also given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent Speech segmentation Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking separate it into words A subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it Text to speech Given a text transform those units and produce a spoken representation Text to speech can be used to aid the visually impaired 23 Word segmentation Tokenization Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words For a language like English this is fairly trivial since words are usually separated by spaces However some written languages like Chinese Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language Sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words BOW creation in data mining Morphological analysis edit Lemmatization The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma Lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form But in this case the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form 24 Morphological segmentation Separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology i e the structure of words of the language being considered English has fairly simple morphology especially inflectional morphology and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word e g open opens opened opening as separate words In languages such as Turkish or Meitei a highly agglutinated Indian language however such an approach is not possible as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms 25 Part of speech tagging Given a sentence determine the part of speech POS for each word Many words especially common ones can serve as multiple parts of speech For example book can be a noun the book on the table or verb to book a flight set can be a noun verb or adjective and out can be any of at least five different parts of speech Stemming The process of reducing inflected or sometimes derived words to a base form e g close will be the root for closed closing close closer etc Stemming yields similar results as lemmatization but does so on grounds of rules not a dictionary Syntactic analysis edit Part of a series onFormal languages Key concepts Formal system Alphabet Syntax Semantics computer science Semantics logic Formal grammar Automata theory Ground expression Regular expression Well formed formula Applications Formal methods Propositional calculus Predicate logic Mathematical notation Natural language processing Programming language theory Computational linguistics Syntax analysis Formal verification vte Grammar induction 26 Generate a formal grammar that describes a language s syntax Sentence breaking also known as sentence boundary disambiguation Given a chunk of text find the sentence boundaries Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks but these same characters can serve other purposes e g marking abbreviations Parsing Determine the parse tree grammatical analysis of a given sentence The grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses perhaps surprisingly for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human There are two primary types of parsing dependency parsing and constituency parsing Dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence marking things like primary objects and predicates whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic context free grammar PCFG see also stochastic grammar Lexical semantics of individual words in context edit Lexical semantics What is the computational meaning of individual words in context Distributional semantics How can we learn semantic representations from data Named entity recognition NER Given a stream of text determine which items in the text map to proper names such as people or places and what the type of each such name is e g person location organization Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient For example the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized and named entities often span several words only some of which are capitalized Furthermore many other languages in non Western scripts e g Chinese or Arabic do not have any capitalization at all and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names For example German capitalizes all nouns regardless of whether they are names and French and Spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives Another name for this task is token classification 27 Sentiment analysis see also Multimodal sentiment analysis Extract subjective information usually from a set of documents often using online reviews to determine polarity about specific objects It is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in social media for marketing Terminology extraction The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus Word sense disambiguation WSD Many words have more than one meaning we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context For this problem we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses e g from a dictionary or an online resource such as WordNet Entity linking Many words typically proper names refer to named entities here we have to select the entity a famous individual a location a company etc which is referred to in context Relational semantics semantics of individual sentences edit Relationship extraction Given a chunk of text identify the relationships among named entities e g who is married to whom Semantic parsing Given a piece of text typically a sentence produce a formal representation of its semantics either as a graph e g in AMR parsing or in accordance with a logical formalism e g in DRT parsing This challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary NLP tasks from semantics e g semantic role labelling word sense disambiguation and can be extended to include full fledged discourse analysis e g discourse analysis coreference see Natural language understanding below Semantic role labelling see also implicit semantic role labelling below Given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates e g verbal frames then identify and classify the frame elements semantic roles Discourse semantics beyond individual sentences edit Coreference resolution Given a sentence or larger chunk of text determine which words mentions refer to the same objects entities Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so called bridging relationships involving referring expressions For example in a sentence such as He entered John s house through the front door the front door is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John s house rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to Discourse analysis This rubric includes several related tasks One task is discourse parsing i e identifying the discourse structure of a connected text i e the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences e g elaboration explanation contrast Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text e g yes no question content question statement assertion etc Implicit semantic role labelling Given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates e g verbal frames and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence see Semantic role labelling above Then identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified and resolve the former against the local text A closely related task is zero anaphora resolution i e the extension of coreference resolution to pro drop languages Recognizing textual entailment Given two text fragments determine if one being true entails the other entails the other s negation or allows the other to be either true or false 28 Topic segmentation and recognition Given a chunk of text separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic and identify the topic of the segment Argument mining The goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs 29 Such argumentative structures include the premise conclusions the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument or the main and counter argument within discourse 30 31 Higher level NLP applications edit Automatic summarization text summarization Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text Often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type such as research papers articles in the financial section of a newspaper Grammatical error correction Grammatical error detection and correction involves a great band width of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis phonology orthography morphology syntax semantics pragmatics Grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire English as a second language It has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since 2011 32 33 34 As far as orthography morphology syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as GPT 2 this can now 2019 be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications Logic translation Translate a text from a natural language into formal logic Machine translation MT Automatically translate text from one human language to another This is one of the most difficult problems and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed AI complete i e requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess grammar semantics facts about the real world etc to solve properly Natural language understanding NLU Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closed world assumption CWA vs open world assumption or subjective Yes No vs objective True False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization 35 Natural language generation NLG Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language Book generation Not an NLP task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other NLP tasks is the creation of full fledged books The first machine generated book was created by a rule based system in 1984 Racter The policeman s beard is half constructed 36 The first published work by a neural network was published in 2018 1 the Road marketed as a novel contains sixty million words Both these systems are basically elaborate but non sensical semantics free language models The first machine generated science book was published in 2019 Beta Writer Lithium Ion Batteries Springer Cham 37 Unlike Racter and 1 the Road this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization Document AI A Document AI platform sits on top of the NLP technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence machine learning or NLP to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types NLP powered Document AI enables non technical teams to quickly access information hidden in documents for example lawyers business analysts and accountants 38 Dialogue management Computer systems intended to converse with a human Question answering Given a human language question determine its answer Typical questions have a specific right answer such as What is the capital of Canada but sometimes open ended questions are also considered such as What is the meaning of life Text to image generation Given a description of an image generate an image that matches the description 39 Text to scene generation Given a description of a scene generate a 3D model of the scene 40 41 Text to video Given a description of a video generate a video that matches the description 42 43 General tendencies and possible future directions edit Based on long standing trends in the field it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP As of 2020 three trends among the topics of the long standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed 44 Interest on increasingly abstract cognitive aspects of natural language 1999 2001 shallow parsing 2002 03 named entity recognition 2006 09 2017 18 dependency syntax 2004 05 2008 09 semantic role labelling 2011 12 coreference 2015 16 discourse parsing 2019 semantic parsing Increasing interest in multilinguality and potentially multimodality English since 1999 Spanish Dutch since 2002 German since 2003 Bulgarian Danish Japanese Portuguese Slovenian Swedish Turkish since 2006 Basque Catalan Chinese Greek Hungarian Italian Turkish since 2007 Czech since 2009 Arabic since 2012 2017 40 languages 2018 60 100 languages Elimination of symbolic representations rule based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods representation learning and end to end systems Cognition edit Most higher level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language More broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above Cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses 45 Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes 46 Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics 47 Especially during the age of symbolic NLP the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies As an example George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing NLP algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics 48 with two defining aspects Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by Lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author 49 For example consider the English word big When used in a comparison That is a big tree the author s intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience When used metaphorically Tomorrow is a big day the author s intent to imply importance The intent behind other usages like in She is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information Assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed e g by means of a probabilistic context free grammar PCFG The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in US

linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s Nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks e g of cognitive grammar 51 functional grammar 52 construction grammar 53 computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience e g ACT R however with limited uptake in mainstream NLP as measured by presence on major conferences 54 of the ACL More recently ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability e g under the notion of cognitive AI 55 Likewise ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP although rarely made explicit 56 and developments in artificial intelligence specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches 57 and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the

cases that stress the limits of its theoretical models comparable to pathological phenomena in mathematics typically created using thought experiments rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real world data as is the case in corpus linguistics The creation and use of such corpora of real world data is a fundamental part of machine learning algorithms for natural language processing In addition theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so called poverty of the stimulus argument entail that general learning algorithms as are typically used in machine learning cannot be successful in language processing As a result the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing Bengio Yoshua

wikipedia the free encyclopedia field of linguistics and computer science for other uses see nlp this article is about natural language processing done by computers for the natural language processing done by the human brain see language processing in the brain natural language processing nlp is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics it is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language it involves processing natural language datasets such as text corpora or speech corpora using either rule based or probabilistic i e statistical and most recently neural network based machine learning approaches the goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents including the contextual nuances of the language within them the technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition natural language understanding and natural language generation history edit further information history of natural language processing natural language processing has its roots in the 1940s 1 already in 1940 alan turing published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language symbolic nlp 1950s early 1990s edit the premise of symbolic nlp is well summarized by john searle s chinese room experiment given a collection of rules e g a chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other nlp tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s the georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty russian sentences into english the authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem 2 however real progress was much slower and after the alpac report in 1966 which found that ten year long research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced little further research in machine translation was conducted in america though some research continued elsewhere such as japan and europe 3 until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were shrdlu a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and eliza a simulation of a rogerian psychotherapist written by joseph weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 using almost no information about human thought or emotion eliza sometimes provided a startlingly human like interaction when the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base eliza might provide a generic response for example responding to my head hurts with why do you say your head hurts ross quillian s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time 4 1970s during the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured real world information into computer understandable data examples are margie schank 1975 sam cullingford 1978 pam wilensky 1978 talespin meehan 1976 qualm lehnert 1977 politics carbonell 1979 and plot units lehnert 1981 during this time the first chatterbots were written e g parry 1980s the 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in nlp focus areas of the time included research on rule based parsing e g the development of hpsg as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology e g two level morphology 5 semantics e g lesk algorithm reference e g within centering theory 6 and other areas of natural language understanding e g in the rhetorical structure theory other lines of research were continued e g the development of chatterbots with racter and jabberwacky an important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period 7 statistical nlp 1990s 2010s edit up until the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand written rules starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing this was due to both the steady increase in computational power see moore s law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of chomskyan theories of linguistics e g transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine learning approach to language processing 8 1990s many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in nlp occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at ibm research such as ibm alignment models these systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the parliament of canada and the european union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government however most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems as a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s with the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data has become available since the mid 1990s research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi supervised learning algorithms such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non annotated data generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data however there is an enormous amount of non annotated data available including among other things the entire content of the world wide web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical neural nlp present edit in 2003 word n gram model at the time the best statistical algorithm was overperformed by a multi layer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a cpu cluster in language modelling by yoshua bengio with co authors 9 in 2010 tom mikolov then a phd student at brno university of technology with co authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling 10 and in the following years he went on to develop word2vec in the 2010s representation learning and deep neural network style featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing that popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques 11 12 can achieve state of the art results in many natural language tasks e g in language modeling 13 and parsing 14 15 this is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where nlp helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care 16 or protect patient privacy 17 approaches symbolic statistical neural networks edit symbolic approach i e the hand coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by ai in general and by nlp in particular 18 19 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the rule based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar e g containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input e g with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the rule based systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to rule based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems although rule based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of llms in 2023 before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods e g for the machine translation of low resource languages such as provided by the apertium system for preprocessing in nlp pipelines e g tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of nlp pipelines e g for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses statistical approach edit in the late 1980s and mid 1990s the statistical approach ended a period of ai winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule based approaches 20 21 the earliest decision trees producing systems of hard if then rules were still very similar to the old rule based approaches only the introduction of hidden markov models applied to part of speech tagging announced the end of the old rule based approach neural networks edit further information artificial neural network a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering since 2015 22 the statistical approach was replaced by the neural networks approach using word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words intermediate tasks e g part of speech tagging and dependency parsing have not been needed anymore neural machine translation based on then newly invented sequence to sequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation common nlp tasks edit the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing some of these tasks have direct real world applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience a coarse division is given below text and speech processing edit optical character recognition ocr given an image representing printed text determine the corresponding text speech recognition given a sound clip of a person or people speaking determine the textual representation of the speech this is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed ai complete see above in natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition see below in most spoken languages the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process also given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent speech segmentation given a sound clip of a person or people speaking separate it into words a subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it text to speech given a text transform those units and produce a spoken representation text to speech can be used to aid the visually impaired 23 word segmentation tokenization separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words for a language like english this is fairly trivial since words are usually separated by spaces however some written languages like chinese japanese and thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words bow creation in data mining morphological analysis edit lemmatization the task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form but in this case the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form 24 morphological segmentation separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes the difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology i e the structure of words of the language being considered english has fairly simple morphology especially inflectional morphology and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word e g open opens opened opening as separate words in languages such as turkish or meitei a highly agglutinated indian language however such an approach is not possible as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms 25 part of speech tagging given a sentence determine the part of speech pos for each word many words especially common ones can serve as multiple parts of speech for example book can be a noun the book on the table or verb to book a flight set can be a noun verb or adjective and out can be any of at least five different parts of speech stemming the process of reducing inflected or sometimes derived words to a base form e g close will be the root for closed closing close closer etc stemming yields similar results as lemmatization but does so on grounds of rules not a dictionary syntactic analysis edit part of a series onformal languages key concepts formal system alphabet syntax semantics computer science semantics logic formal grammar automata theory ground expression regular expression well formed formula applications formal methods propositional calculus predicate logic mathematical notation natural language processing programming language theory computational linguistics syntax analysis formal verification vte grammar induction 26 generate a formal grammar that describes a language s syntax sentence breaking also known as sentence boundary disambiguation given a chunk of text find the sentence boundaries sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks but these same characters can serve other purposes e g marking abbreviations parsing determine the parse tree grammatical analysis of a given sentence the grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses perhaps surprisingly for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human there are two primary types of parsing dependency parsing and constituency parsing dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence marking things like primary objects and predicates whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic context free grammar pcfg see also stochastic grammar lexical semantics of individual words in context edit lexical semantics what is the computational meaning of individual words in context distributional semantics how can we learn semantic representations from data named entity recognition ner given a stream of text determine which items in the text map to proper names such as people or places and what the type of each such name is e g person location organization although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as english this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient for example the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized and named entities often span several words only some of which are capitalized furthermore many other languages in non western scripts e g chinese or arabic do not have any capitalization at all and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names for example german capitalizes all nouns regardless of whether they are names and french and spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives another name for this task is token classification 27 sentiment analysis see also multimodal sentiment analysis extract subjective information usually from a set of documents often using online reviews to determine polarity about specific objects it is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in social media for marketing terminology extraction the goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus word sense disambiguation wsd many words have more than one meaning we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context for this problem we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses e g from a dictionary or an online resource such as wordnet entity linking many words typically proper names refer to named entities here we have to select the entity a famous individual a location a company etc which is referred to in context relational semantics semantics of individual sentences edit relationship extraction given a chunk of text identify the relationships among named entities e g who is married to whom semantic parsing given a piece of text typically a sentence produce a formal representation of its semantics either as a graph e g in amr parsing or in accordance with a logical formalism e g in drt parsing this challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary nlp tasks from semantics e g semantic role labelling word sense disambiguation and can be extended to include full fledged discourse analysis e g discourse analysis coreference see natural language understanding below semantic role labelling see also implicit semantic role labelling below given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates e g verbal frames then identify and classify the frame elements semantic roles discourse semantics beyond individual sentences edit coreference resolution given a sentence or larger chunk of text determine which words mentions refer to the same objects entities anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer the more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so called bridging relationships involving referring expressions for example in a sentence such as he entered john s house through the front door the front door is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of john s house rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to discourse analysis this rubric includes several related tasks one task is discourse parsing i e identifying the discourse structure of a connected text i e the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences e g elaboration explanation contrast another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text e g yes no question content question statement assertion etc implicit semantic role labelling given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates e g verbal frames and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence see semantic role labelling above then identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified and resolve the former against the local text a closely related task is zero anaphora resolution i e the extension of coreference resolution to pro drop languages recognizing textual entailment given two text fragments determine if one being true entails the other entails the other s negation or allows the other to be either true or false 28 topic segmentation and recognition given a chunk of text separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic and identify the topic of the segment argument mining the goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs 29 such argumentative structures include the premise conclusions the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument or the main and counter argument within discourse 30 31 higher level nlp applications edit automatic summarization text summarization produce a readable summary of a chunk of text often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type such as research papers articles in the financial section of a newspaper grammatical error correction grammatical error detection and correction involves a great band width of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis phonology orthography morphology syntax semantics pragmatics grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire english as a second language it has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since 2011 32 33 34 as far as orthography morphology syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as gpt 2 this can now 2019 be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications logic translation translate a text from a natural language into formal logic machine translation mt automatically translate text from one human language to another this is one of the most difficult problems and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed ai complete i e requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess grammar semantics facts about the real world etc to solve properly natural language understanding nlu convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions an explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closed world assumption cwa vs open world assumption or subjective yes no vs objective true false is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization 35 natural language generation nlg convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language book generation not an nlp task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other nlp tasks is the creation of full fledged books the first machine generated book was created by a rule based system in 1984 racter the policeman s beard is half constructed 36 the first published work by a neural network was published in 2018 1 the road marketed as a novel contains sixty million words both these systems are basically elaborate but non sensical semantics free language models the first machine generated science book was published in 2019 beta writer lithium ion batteries springer cham 37 unlike racter and 1 the road this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization document ai a document ai platform sits on top of the nlp technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence machine learning or nlp to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types nlp powered document ai enables non technical teams to quickly access information hidden in documents for example lawyers business analysts and accountants 38 dialogue management computer systems intended to converse with a human question answering given a human language question determine its answer typical questions have a specific right answer such as what is the capital of canada but sometimes open ended questions are also considered such as what is the meaning of life text to image generation given a description of an image generate an image that matches the description 39 text to scene generation given a description of a scene generate a 3d model of the scene 40 41 text to video given a description of a video generate a video that matches the description 42 43 general tendencies and possible future directions edit based on long standing trends in the field it is possible to extrapolate future directions of nlp as of 2020 three trends among the topics of the long standing series of conll shared tasks can be observed 44 interest on increasingly abstract cognitive aspects of natural language 1999 2001 shallow parsing 2002 03 named entity recognition 2006 09 2017 18 dependency syntax 2004 05 2008 09

2017 40 languages 2018 60 100 languages elimination of symbolic representations rule based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods representation learning and end to end systems cognition edit most higher level nlp applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language more broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of nlp see trends among conll shared tasks above cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses 45 cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes 46 cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics 47 especially during the age of symbolic nlp the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies as an example george lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing nlp algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics 48 with two defining aspects apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author 49 for example consider the english word big when used in a comparison that is a big tree the author s intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience when used metaphorically tomorrow is a big day the author s intent to imply importance the intent behind other usages like in she is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive nlp algorithm alike without additional information assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed e g by means of a probabilistic context free grammar pcfg the mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in us

linguistics are part of the historical heritage of nlp but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models

typical phenomena that occur in real world data as is the case in corpus linguistics the creation and use of such corpora of real world data is a fundamental part of machine learning algorithms for natural language processing in addition theoretical underpinnings of chomskyan linguistics such as the so called poverty of the stimulus argument entail that general learning algorithms as are
